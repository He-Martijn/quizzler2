# quizzler2

The quizzler app as given by Angela Yu, attempt 2.

# About this repo
I follow the flutter course on Udemy. 
This lesson is all about classes and OOP. My first attempt was this repo :
https://github.com/He-Martijn/scorekeeper.git 

But I messed up. And well that's also learning.
So I decided to start over again with this repo. 

Beause I learned a lot from reading other students work, I decided to share my work as much as possible. 
As far as my ownership goes of this repository I publish this under the MIT license. 

This repo is not going to be published as an app in any of the app stores. 

Regards, Martijn.
